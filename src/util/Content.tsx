MongoDB stores the unique player identifiers which are needed to make game-related requests. Each time user visits the leaderboard page, a request (using player identifiers) fetching player data from the backend is made. If cache data exists, server returns it in the response, otherwise, a request to Henrik API is made. Once frontend has the required data, it is displayed on the leaderboard.",
